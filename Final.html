            <p>Our game is a Deal or No Deal game, you start off on a splash screen that is<br>
                animated when you are ready click the start game button with your mouse.<br>
                You will then be brought to the main screen where you are to eliminate 6 <br>
                boxes by clicking on each box you want to eliminate the number. As soon as the 6<br>
                boxes are clicked a next screen will appear that offers the user a deal depending<br>
                on the total amount of money left in the boxes you havenâ€™t eliminated. You then<br>
                have to make the choice to take the deal where you will be brought to a scree <br>
                that shows you how much money you eliminated in the first round and the game will<br>
                be over. Or click no deal and you will bring back to the main screen and eliminate<br>
                5 more boxes. The game will repeat in this style eliminating 6,5,5,4,3,2,1 with a<br>
                new deal between each round getting progressively higher in value. You can either<br>
                take the deal or be given on box and you receive whatever is in that box no matter<br>
                the value.</p>
